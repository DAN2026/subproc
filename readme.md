### Testing Potential Subprocess Solution.

This is the repo where I will be testing my potential solution to a fairly large issue in terms of subprocceses within our main system. I choose to do a seperate repo to test this in order to practice using the subprocess module and setup a proper architecture.

What I aim to improve upon:

- To increase my understanding of subproc and multi-processing module.
- To simulate similiar process handling to our main repo.
